# AE Code Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build a solution comprised of REST APIs that finds the closest port to a given ship and calculates the estimated arrival time based on velocity and geolocation (longitude and latitude) of given ship. Requirements are;

* Each port has a name and geolocation. Seed your solution with initial (or randomly generated) port data. No REST API is required for creating ports. 
* Each ship has a name, a unique ship id, geolocation (current longitude and latitude of the ship) and velocity. Develop basic REST APIs to manage ships.
* Develop an API which returns the details of closest port and estimated arrival time of given ship.

Using C# is a must for this solution. Aside from that, feel free to use other technologies/tools/frameworks/libraries ...etc

## Stories
1. As a consumer of the API, I want to be able to add ships to the system.
2. As a consumer of the API, I want to be able to see all ships in the system.
3. As a consumer of the API, I want to be able to update velocity of a ship.
4. As a consumer of the API, I want to be able to see the closest port to a ship with estimated arrival time to the port together with other details.
